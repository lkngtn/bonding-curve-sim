# Crypto Mesa ðŸ”¬
------------
This package provides standard implementations of [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/) Agents, Models, and Schedulers intended for token engineering and analysis.

Researchers can use these base classes when simulating token economies to reduce implementation time and create more consistent simulations.
